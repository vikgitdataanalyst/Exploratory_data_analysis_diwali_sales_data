# Exploratory_data_analysis_diwali_sales_data

Hello! everyone , welcome to my github profile

In this project, I performed data cleaning and manipulation using Pandas to handle missing values, correct data types, and structure the dataset for analysis. Using Matplotlib and Seaborn, I conducted Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to uncover key insights and trends. The analysis focused on improving customer experience by identifying purchasing patterns across different states, genders, occupations, and age groups. Through visualizations and statistical insights, I highlighted factors influencing sales and customer preferences, aiding in data-driven decision-making for targeted marketing strategies.
